# Train-Time
This application will allow a user to add a train name, destination, first train departure time and train intervals. 

The application then displays the name of the train, its destination, frequency, next train arrival and finally the amount of minutes left until the next train arrives.

The application is integrated with Firebase, thus the data is persistent even after a refresh of the page or clearing local data / cookies.
